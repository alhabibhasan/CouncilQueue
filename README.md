# FirmStep Web Dev. task

1. To run clone the directory and go into the root directory of the project.
2. run the command `rails server`.
3. This *should* start the server and the website should be up and running on localhost:3000

## General Info
Created using `Rails 5.0.6` and `ruby 2.2.6p396 (2016-11-15 revision 56800) [i386-mingw32]` on Windows 10.
Uses a MySQL data hosted using a free hosting platform. So the database won't stay online for more than two weeks from today (26/10/17).

## Why I chose Ruby on Rails (RoR)

I saw that Firmstep prefers JS and PHP, but I am more familiar with RoR so could work quicker with it and already had it set up on my laptop.
I also chose RoR as it favours configuration over customisation so a lot of 'good practices' are in build e.g. MVC. Also, Rails has a lot of extra methods/libraries which make setting up a database and saving data much easier compared to other frameworks.

I also chose to use bootstrap to avoid having to focus too much on the CSS.

Given some more time, I would probably polish the code up a bit more and make the website prettier. And test it much **much** more.
